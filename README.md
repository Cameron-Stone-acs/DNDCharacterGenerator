# DNDCharacterGenerator
For this project, you must write and execute Java code that creates three (3) named randomly generated characters in the old D&D style. They will possess 6 characteristics STR - Strength, INT - Intelligence, WIS - Wisdom, CON - Constitution, DEX - Dexterity, and CHR - Charisma. These characteristics will be generated (rolled) using numbers between 3-18 (3D6). This will be done using Java's random number function.  You may not use a random number library.  Each of these characters will be named and saved to a file named - CHARACTERS.TXT. All 3 characters must be distinctly named and saved by the user. Once finished the project must state "Your characters have been saved. Please continue into the game.". You must comment on your code explaining what you did on the project and why. Include your name, period, and the date in the comments in a block at the beginning. The only allowed code is stuff that we have already learned.
